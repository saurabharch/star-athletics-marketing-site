With over 20 years of experience in the health and fitness industry in personal training, group fitness and studio management, I joined the Star coaching team in 2016 and have never looked back! Bringing a positive energy and a keen eye for detail, I aim to unlock the potential of each athlete, ignite a passion for athletics, and motivate and encourage each child to be their best selves.

At Star, we are process driven and have an individualised approach to ensure each child is challenged in a way that is both stimulating and rewarding. We have had great success in helping our young athletes achieve their goals with many reaching regional and state representation in their sports, however this has come through laying strong foundations, teaching patience and ensuring fun and social connection is front and centre in our sessions.

It is extremely rewarding to witness our young athletes master skills and reach new heights whilst also developing confidence, resilience and life skills. My nurturing approach ensures everyone feels included and a valued member of our athletics family. Together we can break down barriers, reach out of our comfort zone and reap the rewards!
