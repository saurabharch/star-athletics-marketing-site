Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Heather,

In 2014, I embarked on a mission of creating Star Athletics, driven by my deep desire to nurture young athletes, ensuring their long-term well-being and holistic development. Our coaching styles have been a resounding success, with countless athletes representing their state in athletics, cross country, and their chosen sports. Witnessing the growth and accomplishments of these incredible individuals fills my heart with immense joy.

Get ready to be inspired: With  14 years of experience as a PDHPE (Physical Development, Health, and Physical Education) teacher and a decade of coaching athletics under my belt, I bring an infectious level of energy and enthusiasm to the table. But that's not all! My coaching journey has taken me on an incredible adventure, from coaching the Vevey Triathlon club in Switzerland to the Northern Beaches of Sydney, spreading positivity in the athletic realm.

But wait, there's more! I've had the delightful opportunity to dabble in the exhilarating world of speed and agility training for basketball, both in Switzerland and Australia. This vibrant experience has allowed me to uncover the secrets of peak performance and tailor my coaching approaches to bring out the very best in athletes from various sports.

Qualifications:

- IAAF kids coaching
- Level 2 recreational running
- Level 3 athletics club coach
- Bachelor of Physical Education
- Master of Management, Events

I'm excited to embrace the next chapter of my coaching journey, mastering the components of Throws, Sprints/Hurdles/Relays, and middle and distance training. The thrill of expanding my knowledge and skills propels me to provide nothing but the utmost care and guidance to my athletes.

So, get ready to join me on this uplifting journey!
