  Star Athletics is the ultimate running community for kids. Not only does it
  teach the very best in running (short and long distance) it creates a wealth
  of knowledge in the kids about the importance of being active, being fair and
  celebrating everyone. We love our Tuesday Run Club and cannot thank Kirsten
  enough for her continued dedication and passion to our kids and their running.
