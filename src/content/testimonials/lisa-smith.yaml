  We were so lucky to come across Heather as a coach. My son needed coaching on
  running technique and speed to assist with his basketball and AFL (especially
  as he has suffered from Severs in the past). Heather is beyond amazing, with
  her expert guidance he has improved enormously and to date has had no injuries
  in his games thanks to her educating him on the importance of warming-up
  properly and stretching. We are so grateful to have Heather as a coach, her
  passion, drive and expert knowledge is just a bonus to how beautifully she
  interacts with all the kids she coaches. They adore her!
